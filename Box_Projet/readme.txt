Dependencies: 
    The following Python libraries are required to run the programs:
    pysais: suffix array construction
        pip install pysais
    bitarray: efficient bit manipulation
        pip install bitarray
    suffix-tree: suffix tree implementation
        pip install suffix-tree


Program 1: MAW Detection
    Usage
        Run the first program using the following command:
        python all_MAW.py <file_fasta> <max_length> <nb_seq_max>
            <fasta_file>: Input FASTA file containing DNA sequences
            <max_length>: Maximum length of minimal absent words to search for
            <nb_seq_max>: Maximum number of sequences to process from the FASTA file
    Output
        The results are saved in a file named:
        MAW - <max_length> <nb_seq_max>.tsv
        The output file contains the following columns:
            Sequence: Name of the DNA sequence
            k: Length of the minimal absent word
            Number of MAWs: Count of MAWs of length k
            MAWs: List of minimal absent words of length k

Program 2: p-MAW Detection
    Usage  
        Run the second program using the following command:
        python all_pMAW <input.tsv> <p> <max_length>
            <input.tsv>: Input file generated by Program 1
            <p>: Proportion threshold (must be between 0 and 1)
            <max_length>: Maximum length of p-MAWs to compute
    Output
        The results are saved in a file named:
        pMAW.tsv
    The output file contains the following columns:
        k: Length of the p-MAW
        Number of p-MAWs: Count of p-MAWs of length k
        p-MAWs: List of p-MAWs of length k


When running Program 2, the following additional parameters are displayed in the terminal:
    γ (gamma): Proportion of valid patterns among the tested ones.
    δ (delta): Average number of new patterns generated for each valid pattern.
These parameters help evaluate the efficiency of the p-MAW detection algorithm.
